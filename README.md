# Camera Object Detection

This is a personal project to start messing around with AI and see what it can do. I'm using some cool libraries and frameworks to learn the basics. I think it's a good starting point, and I plan to try out different kinds of AI projects as I go.

### Ultralytics & YOLO

Ultralytics is a collection of computer vision tools, and YOLO is a popular object detection model that can identify objects in images or video.

### OpenCV (cv2)

A library used for real-time computer vision.

### Local Development

In order to run this code, you will need to have Python installed on your machine and install the following libraries:
    
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install ultralytics

Finally, run the file by executing:

    python3 main.py
